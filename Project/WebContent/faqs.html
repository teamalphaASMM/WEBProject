<h1> Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
</div>

<div class="column">

	<h2>Q1: What is an express entry profile?</h2>
	
	<p>Potential candidates make an expression of interest (EOI) in coming to Canada by creating 
an Express Entry profile and providing information about their skills, work experience, 
language ability, education, and other personal information. This profile is self-declared; 
that is to say that the material provided by the potential candidate is based on his or her 
own assessment of his or her personal information.</p>
	
</div>
<div class="column">

	<h2>Q2: What is the express entry pool?</h2>
	<p>	Potential candidates who create an Express Entry profile and are eligible for one of Canada’s 
economic immigration programs enter the Express Entry pool. These programs are the Federal 
Skilled Worker Class, the Federal Skilled Trades Class, the Canadian Experience Class, 
and a portion of the Provincial Nominee Programs. The federal government and provincial 
governments, as well as Canadian employers, are able to select candidates from this pool. 
Candidates who are selected then receive an ‘Invitation to Apply’ (ITA) for immigration 
to Canada under one of the programs.</p>
	
</div>
<div class="column">

	<h2>Q3: What does invitation to apply(ITA) mean?</h2>
	<p>An Invitation to Apply (ITA) is offered to any candidate in the Express Entry pool 
who has been selected to apply for immigration to Canada by Immigration, Refugees 
and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). A candidate who receives an ITA will have meet the 
requirements in one of IRCC’s draws from the pool. This includes meeting the minimum 
Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) cut-off threshold for that draw.</p>
	
</div>

<div class="column">

	<h2>Q4: What is the comprehensive ranking system?</h2>
	<p>The Comprehensive Ranking System is the government of Canada’s internal mechanism 
for ranking candidates bases on their human capital, determined by factors such as age, 
level of education and language ability. This helps to enable Immigration, Refugees and 
Citizenship Canada (IRCC, formerly known as CIC) to decide which candidates may be issued 
invitations to apply for permanent residence. There are up to 600 points available under 
the system for a candidate's core human capital and skills transferability factors. 
Up to 600 additional points are available for additional factors (including a provincial 
nomination, an offer of arranged employment, and/or prior Canadian study experience).</p>
	
</div>
<div class="column">

	<h2>Q5: Do candidates need to take language tests?</h2>
	<p> Yes, all candidates need to take a language test in order to determine their language abilities. 
There are a set number of points available for language ability for each of the economic immigration 
programs that come under Express Entry, and ability must be proven by candidates taking a standardized 
language test approved by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC, formerly known as CIC). 
The most popular are IELTS for English and TEF for French.
	</p>
	
</div>
<div class="column">

	<h2>Q6: Can an candidate apply directly to a province under PNP?</h2>
	<p>Yes, a portion of the PNPs, known as the "enhanced" portion, are managed inside Express Entry, 
with the remainder operating external to Express Entry. The CanadaVisa immigration assessment 
form assesses your eligibility for immigration across a range of immigration programs, including the various PNPs. </p>
	
</div>
<div class="column">

	<h2>Q7: Do I require a letter of support from my financial partner(s)?</h2>
	<p>IRCC requires confirmation of all sources of funding in connection with the applications 
	submitted to this open intake process. This can be provided via a copy of a letter from the funder, 
	an existing memorandum of understanding, letter of intent, correspondence from a funding partner, 
	etc… Applicants in possession of such a document pertaining to their current application do not need 
	to request a new and separate document from their funder(s). If your current evidence pertains to the 
	project for which you are not seeking funding from IRCC, then you should provide it along with your application.
	Please note that if you identify funding partners and do not provide evidence of their commitment to your project, 
	then your application will not be accepted. If in doubt about acceptable evidence, please contact IRCC..</p>
	
</div>
<div class="column">

	<h2>Q8: If my Express Entry profile expires, will the system keep my information?</h2>
	<p>No, the system will not keep your information. We had planned to allow the system to 
	save profile information, so it would be easier to complete a new profile when the first one 
	expired. We have found that this option is not possible at this time. Should the option become 
	available in the future, we will update this information online. If your profile is about to expire, 
	you must complete and submit a new one if you want to stay in the Express Entry pool.You can save screen 
	shots of your profile to make it easier to re-enter your data.Do not create a new profile until your existing 
	one expires. If you decide to create and submit a new profile before your existing one expires, you will need to 
	withdraw your existing profile first.</p>
